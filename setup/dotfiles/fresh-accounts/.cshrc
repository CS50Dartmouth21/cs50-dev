# Source master file.  If you are a power user or control freak, you
# may want to copy it to this location, i.e.
#
#	cp /usr/local/lib/templates/master.cshrc ~/.cshrc
#
# If you do this, however, future changes to the master copy will not
# affect your account.  If you have only minor customizations to make,
# you can simply add code either before or after sourcing the master
# file.
