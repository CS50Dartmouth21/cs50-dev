# 'dot' files for Virtualbox Linux

These files are automatically installed in your Virtualbox home directory, `/home/vagrant`, as part of the CS50 set-up process.

For readability, the filenames here do not have the preceding dot (`.`) character.
A dot should be added to the filename when installing them in a home directory.

But, we may occasionally provide enhancements or corrections to these files; those changes will show up here when you `git pull` inside of the `cs50-dev` repo.
We may instruct you to copy these changes to your `/home/vagrant` copy of the file.
