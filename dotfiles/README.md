# 'dot' files

The files in this folder are meant to be installed in your home directory (`~`) and are used by `bash`, `git`, `emacs` and others for configuration.
See specific instructions in each subdirectory here.

**Note:** we may occasionally provide enhancements or corrections to these files; those changes will show up here when you `git pull` inside of the `cs50-dev` repo.
We may instruct you to copy these changes to your `~` copy of the file.
